# Simple Instagram Feed

This app was created as a simple proof of concept for a customer. The app uses Facebook's [Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api) to pull feed data such as images and associated metadata. Photos are displayed in a responsive grid and photos expand into a lightbox.
